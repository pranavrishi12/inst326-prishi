Week 1
This week we were assigned 30 python exercises and I will not lie, I did use AI to help me out at times.
The LLM I used was Chat GPT. While completing this assignment I focused heavily on completing the assignment with my own knowledge 
and I used the core concepts sheet as well to help me out. I mainly used AI to check my answers to make sure my solution was on track
or correct. I would try to attempt the coding problem then copy my attempt into chat gpt and ask if it was correct. Additionally, some problems
such as problem 14 and 15, I was really stuck on and asked chat gpt for the answer. However, instead of just taking the answer I tried to learn how
the LLM solved so, I can improve my knowledge on the topic.

Week 2
This week, me and my group used AI to help brainstorm what we are building with are project. Chat gpt give us a list of ideas and we expanded on the broad topic it
provided and used it to help generate ideas for the project in general. I also used AI for the week 2 exercises. I primarly used AI to help me make sure my solution is correct, however I felt stuck on some problems so I asked for the answer sometimes but I reread the code so I can understand how it got the answer.

Week 3
This week, I used Chat GPT as tool to help me with the week 3 exercises. For exercises that I was stuck on I would ask the LLM for help and give me a step by step 
explanation to help me understand the code. Other than that I would use AI to make sure my answers are correct or on the right track.
